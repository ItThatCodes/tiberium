tiberium ideas:
search around Crystal for tiberium ore:
 - if not present: % chance to spawn ore
 - if present:
     (option 1) check each block below ore all the way to bedrock looking for other ores, if found:
	   - % chance to replace ore with Stone/dirt/etc... and then either:
	     * record what ore was found in NBT data of tiberium ore for later processing
		 * record how many ores were found in NBT data of tiberium ore for later random processing
		 * do nothing else

(option 2) tiberium ore - pre spawns with Crystal but is not initially visible,
           Then check as above in (option 1) but 'grow' the tiberium ore relative to each other ore leached.

(TBD) HOW DOES TIBERIUM SPREAD [ideally] without making it as broken as Thaumcraft Taint. - EB]
(option 1) as ore is leached, if a threshold is met, ex. 15 ores, convert tiberium ore into new Crystal and spawn new
           tiberium ores based on that Crystal.

NOTE 1: Crystals should remember when they were initially created so that retroactive processing can occur when chunk
        is reloaded.

NOTE 2: Perhaps the tiberium ore should function more like a crop and can be harvested, but cannot be destroyed without
        use of a Harvester.
